# TreeDS - work in progress
TreeDS (tree data structure) is an STL-like tree container type for C++11. It is a header only library that provides the most generic type of tree where every node can have an arbitrary number of children (and the maximum number of children can't be set).

## Features
* STL compatible.
* No exernal dependecies.
* Permissive licence.
* Iterators provided: pre-order, ...
* Expandable with custom iterator types.
* Boost compatibile serialization.

## Getting started
The library is header only, to start using it you just have to add the "include" directory to the include paths and then include it in your C++ file:

    #include <TreeDS/tree.hpp>
